# Library Management System - SWE Lab Assignment

## Overview

This project is a simple C++ implementation of a Library Management System based on the provided class diagram.  
All objects and their attributes are hardcoded in the `main()` function as per assignment requirements.  
No user input is required; the program demonstrates the relationships and method calls automatically.

---

## Files

- `LibraryManagement.cpp` &mdash; Main source code file containing all class definitions and the demo.

## How to Compile and Run

1. **Open a terminal** in the folder containing `LibraryManagement.cpp`.

2. **Compile the code** using g++:
   ```
   g++ -o LibraryManagement LibraryManagement.cpp
   ```

## Notes

- All objects (Library, Shelf, Book, Librarian, Member, Account) are created and associated in code.
- All required methods from the class diagram are called in the demo.
